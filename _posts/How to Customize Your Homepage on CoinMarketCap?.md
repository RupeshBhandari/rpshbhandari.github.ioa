2. The initial setting will be on “Classic,” which contains the data fields we always present to you. You can easily add new fields by clicking any items in the modal, or deselect by clicking again on the items you want to remove. These data fields can also be reordered. Simply drag and drop the field to the desired spot and your homepage will reflect the change straight away!
